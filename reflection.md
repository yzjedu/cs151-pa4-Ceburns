- the goal of this pa is to get mor4e familiar using files and analyzing files using functions. It is also to get more familiar with using tables and acessing specific information from tables. The steps i followed were creating an algorithm, writing the code, and testing it to make sure it works properly. my results did match what i expected to get. The main challenges i encounteres were with the tables and the appearance of them once they were printed. I also struggled with the word count. i fixed them by trying different things and seeing what worked.i do think i learned what i was supposed to because now i have a better grasp on how to use tables and what they are used for.
